# Game of Life (Zig)
A very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). This project was created for learning Zig and Raylib.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a learning project and still a work in progress. Suggestions on how to improve the code are very welcome!

## Demo

## Building

Make sure you have [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) installed (I used version 0.16.0-dev.27+83f773fc6, but I am pretty sure that 0.14.0+ will work).

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cincip/game-of-life-zig.git
cd game-of-life-zig
```
Build and run the project:
```bash
zig build run
```

## TODO
- [ ] Add camera
- [ ] Make a bigger map (maybe infinite map)
- [ ] Add some examples of spaceships or whatever they are called
